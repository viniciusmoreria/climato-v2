## Inspiration
I wanted to try and see how hard would it be to implement one of my favourite weather app design: [Weather App by Emmanuel Ikechukwu](https://dribbble.com/shots/12869395-Weather-App/attachments/4468922?mode=media). Full credits for user experience goes to him.

## Current progress
- [x] App skeleton
- [x] Basic UI prototype
- [x] Call Weather APIs for data
- [x] Implement weather service
- [x] Implement new location from zipcode(Brazil only)
- [ ] Daily weather details
- [ ] Google Search instead of zipcode search
- [ ] Translations
- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Store new locations
- [ ] Swipe to new locations
- [ ] News
- [ ] Alerts

## Development stack
+ [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
+ [Expo](https://expo.io/)
+ [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
+ [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/)

## APIs
+ Weather data is retrieved from [OpenWeather](http://openweathermap.org/)
+ Brazillian zipcodes are retrieved from [ViaCep](https://viacep.com.br/)
+ You can see examples of API data in [Models](https://github.com/viniciusmoreeira/climato-v2/tree/main/src/models)
